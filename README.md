<h2><B><i>COVID-19 Cloud Data Warehouse and Analytics</i></B></h2>

COVID-19 data is being generated by numerous data sources and each data source presents some unique features that could be utilized for meaningful analytics. The goal of this project is to engineer a data warehouse on Microsoft Azure by integrating the major COVID-19 public datasets available through different sources(Google Cloud, GitHub, NYT) via Dimensional Modeling and ETL to perform advanced analytics.

<h5><b>Objectives:</b></h5>
<ul>
<li>Perform source systems analysis on data sources (& compare)
<li>Ingest & Integrate from/to various sources to generate BI Dashboards
<li>Gain experience with cloud databases & cloud DW
<li>Gain experience with data integration & data pipeline tools using data from both cloud and on
premise (notebook) sources</ul>


<h5><b>Deliverables:</b></h5>
<ul>
<li>Dashboards visualizing COVID data tracking US states and counties
<li>Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau or Google Data Studio
<li>Data should be loaded into:<ol>
<li>Google BigQuery
<li>Azure SQL  (note: likely limitations on student credits)
  <li>SQL Server or MySQL (as a fallback if team exhausts their free student credits)</ol>
<li>Review & compare data integration tools</ul>


<h5><b>Tools Used:</h5></b>
<ul>
<li>Talend Data Quality Open Studio - For Data Profiling
<li>Stitch - Used to load COVID public dataset and flat files to Big Query
<li>Talend Pipeline Designer - For creating staging area and for Data Integration
